# The Nova Language Guide

A hands-on, example-driven tour of Nova, a statically-typed language built for **hypermedia web
applications**: the server renders HTML that the browser swaps in. Your whole service compiles to a
single native binary, with the runtime, web framework, TLS, and database drivers all coming from one
toolchain. It pairs with a native orchestrator to run it in production. Every construct here is shown with a **complete,
runnable program**. Each example lives under [`examples/`](examples/) as a real `.nova` file that
compiles and runs; the output shown in each chapter is the program's actual output.

For the terse, citation-backed reference, see [`../language-specification.md`](../language-specification.md).
This guide is the *learning path*; the spec is the *contract*.

## Getting the toolchain

Everything below assumes a `nova` binary on your `PATH`. Nova is currently a build-from-source project
(binary releases are coming): clone the repository and build the toolchain with the bundled Zig
toolchain, which produces a self-contained `nova` (it carries its own linker and runtime, so no system
`clang` or LLVM is needed to compile a program). [Chapter 22](22-building-and-distribution.md) walks
through building and packaging the toolchain, including cross-compiling it for another machine. Once
`nova` is on your `PATH`, the rest of this guide runs as shown.

> On Windows, build and run inside WSL2 for now; native Windows is a cross-compile *target*, not yet a
> run-verified host. See the repository's Windows notes.

## Running the examples

```sh
# from the lang/ directory
nova docs/guide/examples/01_hello.nova -o /tmp/hello && /tmp/hello
```

`nova <file>.nova -o <out>` compiles a native executable; run it directly. Examples that use `@test`
functions run with `nova test <file>.nova`.
